# Railway Logging Rate Limit Fix

## Changes Made

1. **Removed excessive debug logging** from `getGoalTitles` and `getGoalTitlesForUser` functions in `goalsController.js`
2. **Created a new logger utility** (`utils/logger.js`) with rate limiting capabilities
3. **Updated server.js** to use the new logger instead of console.log/console.error
4. **Reduced CRON job logging frequency** using the new logger's cron method

## Key Improvements

- **Rate limiting**: Logger limits to 100 logs per minute per unique message
- **CRON optimization**: CRON messages are logged only once per minute per unique message
- **Environment-aware**: Debug logs only appear in development
- **Structured logging**: All logs include timestamps and log levels

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to Railway
2. **Monitor the logs** for the first few minutes to ensure the rate limit is no longer hit
3. **Check Railway dashboard** to confirm log volume has decreased

## Monitoring

After deployment, you should see:
- Reduced log volume in Railway dashboard
- No more "rate limit of 500 logs/sec reached" errors
- Cleaner, more structured log output

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily disable the logger by:
1. Reverting to console.log statements
2. Or setting `maxLogsPerMinute` to a higher value in `utils/logger.js`

## Expected Results

- Log rate should drop from 500+ logs/sec to under 100 logs/min
- Railway rate limit errors should stop appearing
- Application functionality remains unchanged
