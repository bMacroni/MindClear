# ðŸ§ª AI Function Call Test List

This document contains a comprehensive list of chat requests to test all AI function calls in the MindGarden application.

## **Task Functions**

### **Create Task**

### **Delete Tasks**
- "Delete my laundry task"

### **Read Goals**
- "Show me my goals"
- "List my goals"
- "What are my current goals?"

### **Update Goals**
- "Change the due date for my marathon goal to next June"
- "Update the description of my reading goal"
- "Change the priority of my Spanish learning goal to high"

### **Delete Goals**
- "Delete the goal 'Test goal'"
- "Remove my goal called 'Get fit'"
- "Delete my marathon goal"

### **Lookup Goals** (Precursor function)
- "What goals do I have?" (triggers lookup before other operations)

## **Calendar Event Functions**

### **Create Calendar Events**
- "Schedule a meeting for tomorrow at 10am"
- "Add a calendar event for my doctor appointment next Friday at 2pm"
- "Create an event for team lunch on Wednesday at noon"
- "Schedule a call with John for Monday at 3pm"

### **Read Calendar Events**
- "Show me my calendar events"
- "List my events for next week"
- "What events do I have on Friday?"
- "Show me my calendar for tomorrow"

### **Update Calendar Events**
- "Change the time of my meeting to 11am"
- "Update the location for my doctor appointment to the downtown office"
- "Change my team lunch to Thursday instead of Wednesday"

### **Delete Calendar Events**
- "Delete my meeting on Friday"
- "Remove the doctor appointment from my calendar"
- "Cancel my team lunch event"

### **Lookup Calendar Events** (Precursor function)
- "What events do I have?" (triggers lookup before other operations)

## **Complex Multi-Step Scenarios** (Test the AI's ability to chain functions)

1. **"I want to create a goal to get fit, then add some tasks to help me achieve it"**
   - Should trigger: `lookup_goal` â†’ `create_goal` â†’ `create_task` (multiple times)

2. **"Schedule a meeting for next week, then create a task to prepare for it"**
   - Should trigger: `create_calendar_event` â†’ `create_task`

3. **"Show me my goals, then update the one about fitness"**
   - Should trigger: `read_goal` â†’ `lookup_goal` â†’ `update_goal`

4. **"What tasks do I have? I want to delete the one about groceries"**
   - Should trigger: `lookup_task` â†’ `delete_task`

---

## **Edge Cases to Test**

1. **Ambiguous requests**: "Delete my task" (when multiple tasks exist)
2. **Non-existent items**: "Update my goal called 'Non-existent goal'"
3. **Incomplete data**: "Create a task" (without title)
4. **Natural language dates**: "Schedule something for next Friday"
5. **Priority variations**: "High priority task", "urgent task", "important task"

---

## **Testing Strategy**

1. **Start with simple CRUD operations** for each function type
2. **Test the lookup functions** to ensure they work as precursors
3. **Test multi-step scenarios** to verify function chaining
4. **Test edge cases** to identify potential issues
5. **Test natural language variations** to ensure robust parsing

| `update_task` | Updates existing tasks | "Change", "Update", "Mark as complete" |
| `delete_task` | Removes tasks | "Delete", "Remove" |
| `lookup_task` | Gets task IDs for operations | Precursor to update/delete |
| `create_goal` | Creates new goals | "Set a goal", "Create a goal" |
| `read_goal` | Lists user goals | "Show me my goals", "List goals" |
| `update_goal` | Updates existing goals | "Change goal", "Update goal" |
| `delete_goal` | Removes goals | "Delete goal", "Remove goal" |
| `lookup_goal` | Gets goal IDs for operations | Precursor to update/delete |
| `create_calendar_event` | Creates calendar events | "Schedule", "Add calendar event" |

## **Notes for Testing**

- Test each function type systematically
- Verify that lookup functions work as precursors
- Check that multi-step scenarios execute correctly
- Monitor for any error handling issues
- Test with various natural language inputs
- Verify that the AI correctly interprets user intent
