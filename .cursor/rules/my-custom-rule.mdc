# Mind Clear Development Workflow

## Test-Driven Development
When making major changes, always write test cases first, then make your changes, then run your test cases, fixing your code until it passes each test case.

## User Guidance
If there are external configurations or setups that the user needs to carry out to make your changes work, you need to explain in detail what the user needs to carry out, step-by-step guides are most helpful.

## Branding
The app has been renamed to **Mind Clear**, please use this name for naming schemes instead of when you think you would use MindGarden.

## Development Standards
- Follow the established project structure and naming conventions
- Use the appropriate technology stack for each platform (React/Vite for frontend, React Native for mobile, Node.js/Express for backend)
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Write comprehensive tests for all new features
- Use proper environment variable management
- Follow security best practices

## Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use TypeScript for mobile development
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Follow the established patterns for AI integration and database operations
- Ensure proper performance optimization

## Critical Security Practices
- Never under any circumstance hard code environment variables into our code
