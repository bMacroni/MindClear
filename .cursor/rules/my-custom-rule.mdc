When making major changes, always write test cases first, then make your changes, then run your test cases, fixing your code until it passes each test case.
If there are external configurations or setups that the user needs to carry out to make your changes work, you need to explain in detail what the user needs to carry out, step-by-step guides are most helpful.

After making changes, always inform the user what they should expect to see on the frontend
