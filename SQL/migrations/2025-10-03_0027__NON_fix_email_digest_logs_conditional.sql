-- Migration: Fix email_digest_logs conditional deletion
-- Date: 2025-10-03
-- Description: Updates delete_user_data_atomic to check if email_digest_logs table exists before deleting
-- 
-- This fixes the error: column "user_id" does not exist
-- The email_digest_logs table may not exist in all environments, so we check before deleting

-- Drop and recreate the function with the fix
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS delete_user_data_atomic(UUID, UUID, TEXT, INET);

-- Recreate with audit parameters and conditional email_digest_logs check
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_user_data_atomic(
  target_user_id UUID,
  performed_by UUID DEFAULT NULL,
  reason TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  ip_address INET DEFAULT NULL
)
