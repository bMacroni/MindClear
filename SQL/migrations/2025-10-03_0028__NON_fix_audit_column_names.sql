-- Migration: Fix audit table column names in delete function
-- Date: 2025-10-03
-- Description: Corrects the column names used when inserting into user_deletion_audit
--              (deleted_user_id and deleted_by instead of user_id and performed_by)

-- Drop and recreate the function with correct column names
