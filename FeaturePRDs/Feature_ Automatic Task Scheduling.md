### **Overview**

Add an automatic scheduling capability that allows users to enable tasks for intelligent calendar integration. Once enabled, the system will automatically create calendar events for tasks in available time slots, considering weather conditions, travel time, and user preferences. The system will handle recurring tasks by automatically rescheduling them based on their recurrence intervals.

---

### **Goals**

* Reduce manual calendar management by automatically scheduling tasks in optimal time slots  
* Improve task completion rates through intelligent scheduling that considers external factors  
* Provide a seamless experience for recurring tasks that require ongoing attention  
* Leverage weather data and travel time to optimize scheduling decisions

---

### **User Stories**

* As a user, I want to toggle automatic scheduling for specific tasks so that they get scheduled automatically in my calendar.  
* As a user, I want the system to consider weather conditions when scheduling outdoor tasks so that I don't get scheduled for yard work during rain.  
* As a user, I want the system to account for travel time when scheduling tasks so that I have realistic time estimates.  
* As a user, I want recurring tasks to automatically reschedule after completion so that I maintain consistent progress.  
* As a user, I want to see which tasks are auto-scheduled so that I can manage my automatic scheduling preferences.

* ~~4.2.2. Utilize real-time traffic data if available.~~  
* ~~4.2.3. Support multiple transportation modes (walking, driving, transit).~~

  ### **5\. Recurring Task Management**

  #### **5.1. Recurrence Implementation**

* ~~5.1.1. Allow configuration of recurrence intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).~~  
* ~~5.1.2. Automatically reschedule recurring tasks upon completion.~~

  #### **5.2. Task History Management**

* ~~5.2.1. Maintain task history while creating future scheduling instances.~~  
* ~~5.2.2. Provide options for users to modify recurrence patterns.~~

  ### **6\. Task Status Management**

  #### **6.1. Status Transition Logic**

* ~~6.1.1. Implement default status "Scheduled" upon auto-scheduling.~~  
* ~~6.1.2. Allow user to mark tasks as "In-Progress."~~  
* ~~6.1.3. Automate transition to "In-Progress" for recurring tasks post-completion.~~  
* ~~6.1.4. Ensure non-recurring tasks remain "Completed" after finishing.~~

  ### **7\. Scheduling Preferences**

  #### **7.1. User Preferences Configuration**

* ~~7.1.1. Allow users to set preferred scheduling time windows per task type.~~  
* ~~7.1.2. Implement configurable buffer times between tasks.~~  
* ~~7.1.3. Allow users to set a maximum daily task load.~~  
* ~~7.1.4. Enable definition of priority levels for conflict resolution.~~

#### **Non-Functional**

* Performance: Auto-scheduling should complete within 30 seconds for typical task loads  
* Reliability: System should gracefully handle calendar API failures and retry scheduling  
* Scalability: Support for users with 100+ tasks and complex calendars  
* Accuracy: Weather and travel time data should be within 80% accuracy  
* User Control: Users should be able to disable auto-scheduling globally or per task

### **Technical Considerations**

1. ~~Data Model Updates~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
* ~~Add auto\_schedule\_enabled boolean to task schema~~  
* ~~Add recurrence\_pattern field for recurring tasks~~  
* ~~Add scheduling\_preferences JSON field for user preferences~~  
* ~~Add last\_scheduled\_date timestamp for tracking~~  
1. ~~API Endpoints~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
* ~~POST /api/tasks/{id}/toggle-auto-schedule~~  
* ~~POST /api/tasks/auto-schedule (trigger scheduling for all enabled tasks)~~  
* ~~GET /api/weather/{location} (weather data)~~  
* ~~GET /api/travel-time/{origin}/{destination} (travel time calculation)~~  
1. Background Processing  
* Scheduled job to run auto-scheduling logic  
* Queue system for handling weather and travel API calls  
* Retry mechanism for failed calendar operations  
1. Error Handling  
* Graceful degradation when weather/travel APIs are unavailable  
* User notifications for scheduling conflicts or failures  
* Fallback scheduling when optimal slots aren't available

* Adoption Rate: Percentage of users who enable auto-scheduling for at least one task  
* Task Completion Rate: Improvement in completion rates for auto-scheduled tasks vs. manual tasks  
* User Satisfaction: Positive feedback on time savings and reduced manual scheduling
