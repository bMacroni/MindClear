# üîí MindGarden Security Review Implementation Plan

## **Current Security Posture Assessment**

### **Strengths Found:**
- ‚úÖ Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on some endpoints (tasks archive)
- ‚úÖ Input validation in some controllers
- ‚úÖ Environment variable management
- ‚úÖ WebSocket authentication with timeout

### **Critical Security Gaps Identified:**
- ‚úÖ ~~No security headers (helmet.js missing)~~ **FIXED**
- ‚úÖ ~~CORS configuration is overly permissive~~ **FIXED**
- ‚úÖ ~~Limited input validation and sanitization~~ **FIXED**
- ‚úÖ ~~No request size limits~~ **FIXED**
- ‚úÖ ~~Missing security middleware stack~~ **FIXED**
- ‚ùå No API versioning security
- ‚ùå Insufficient error handling that could leak information
- ‚úÖ ~~No security logging/monitoring~~ **FIXED**
- ‚ùå Missing dependency vulnerability scanning

## **Phase 1: Infrastructure Security Hardening (Priority: CRITICAL)**

### 1.1 Security Headers & Middleware
```powershell
# Add security dependencies
npm install helmet express-validator express-slow-down compression --save
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] Install and configure `helmet.js` for security headers
- [x] Add request size limits with `express.json({ limit: '10mb' })`
- [x] Implement compression middleware
- [x] Add request timing middleware
- [x] Configure proper CORS with specific origins

### 1.2 Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] Implement `express-validator` for all API endpoints
- [x] Add input sanitization for XSS prevention
- [x] Validate all request parameters and body fields
- [x] Implement SQL injection prevention (already using Supabase, but verify)
- [ ] Add file upload validation if applicable

### 1.3 Rate Limiting Enhancement
- [x] Implement global rate limiting
- [x] Add endpoint-specific rate limits
- [x] Implement slow-down middleware for suspicious activity
- [x] Add IP-based blocking for repeated violations
