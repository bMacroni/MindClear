# Calendar Screen Implementation

## Overview

The Calendar Screen is a comprehensive mobile calendar implementation that provides users with day, week, and month views of their scheduled tasks and events. It integrates seamlessly with the existing Foci backend and follows the minimalist black and white design philosophy.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Three View Types**: Day, Week, and Month views
- **Event Display**: Shows both calendar events and tasks with visual differentiation
- **Event Details**: Tap any event to view detailed information
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete directly from the calendar
- **Floating Action Button**: Quick access to create new events
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh calendar data with pull gesture
- **Today Button**: Quick navigation to current date

### ✅ API Integration
- **Calendar Events**: Full CRUD operations via `/api/calendar/events`
- **Tasks Integration**: Displays tasks with due dates as calendar items
- **Real-time Sync**: Placeholder for Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry functionality

### ✅ UI/UX Features
- **Minimalist Design**: Black and white theme consistent with Foci brand
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded events and tasks by priority/type
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for various mobile screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and empty states
- **Haptic Feedback**: Ready for haptic feedback implementation

### ✅ Edge Cases Addressed
- **Offline Support**: Graceful handling of network errors
- **Time Zone Handling**: Uses local timezone for date/time display
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no events are scheduled
- **Error Recovery**: Retry functionality for failed API calls

## Components

### CalendarScreen
The main calendar screen that orchestrates all calendar functionality:
- Manages state for selected date, view type, and data
- Handles API calls for events and tasks
- Renders different views based on user selection
- Provides navigation and interaction controls

### EventCard
A reusable component for displaying events and tasks:
- Supports both compact and full display modes
- Color-coded by priority (tasks) or type (events)
- Shows completion status for tasks
- Handles tap interactions

### EventDetailModal
A comprehensive modal for event/task details:
- Displays all event information
- Provides edit and delete actions
- Allows task completion
- Shows goal associations for tasks

## API Integration

The calendar integrates with existing backend endpoints:

### Calendar Events
- `GET /api/calendar/events` - Fetch all events
- `GET /api/calendar/events/date` - Fetch events for specific date
- `POST /api/calendar/events` - Create new event
- `PUT /api/calendar/events/:id` - Update event
- `DELETE /api/calendar/events/:id` - Delete event

### Tasks
- `GET /api/tasks` - Fetch all tasks
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task (for completion)

## Real-time Sync

The implementation includes a placeholder for Supabase real-time subscriptions:

```typescript
// TODO: Implement Supabase real-time subscription
// This would listen for changes to calendar_events and tasks tables
// and update the local state accordingly
```

This will enable automatic updates when changes are made from other clients.

## Edge Cases & Solutions

### Offline Support
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Retry functionality for failed API calls
- Local state management for better UX

### Time Zone Handling
- Uses local timezone for all date/time display
- Consistent date formatting across the app
- Proper handling of timezone offsets

### All-Day Events
- Supported through the existing calendar API
- Proper display in day and week views

### Overlapping Events
- Events are sorted chronologically
- Visual differentiation between events and tasks
- Compact display mode for dense schedules

### Permissions
- Graceful handling of missing Google Calendar permissions
- Clear error messages for permission issues

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Event Creation/Editing**: Full form implementation
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Reschedule events by dragging
3. **Recurring Events**: Support for recurring event patterns
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by event type, priority, etc.
5. **Search Functionality**: Search events and tasks
6. **Export/Share**: Share calendar views

### Technical Improvements
1. **Supabase Real-time**: Implement live updates
2. **Offline Caching**: Cache calendar data locally
3. **Performance**: Optimize for large datasets
4. **Accessibility**: Improve screen reader support

## Dependencies Added

- `react-native-calendars`: Calendar component library
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`: Date/time picker
- `react-native-gesture-handler`: Gesture support
- `react-native-reanimated`: Animation support

## Testing

The calendar implementation includes:
- Error boundary handling
- Loading state management
- Empty state handling
- Network error recovery
- Type safety with TypeScript

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
- Optimized date calculations
- Minimal API calls with proper caching
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Accessibility

- Proper touch targets for mobile interaction
- Clear visual hierarchy
- High contrast design
- Screen reader friendly labels

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the mobile calendar feature while maintaining the Foci app's design philosophy and user experience standards.
