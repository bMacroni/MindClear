## Rule Files

### Core Rules
- **[project-structure.mdc](mdc:project-structure.mdc)** - Project structure, naming conventions, and technology stack overview
- **[my-custom-rule.mdc](mdc:my-custom-rule.mdc)** - Main development workflow and standards

### Platform-Specific Rules
- **[frontend-development.mdc](mdc:frontend-development.mdc)** - React + Vite + Tailwind CSS development guidelines
- **[mobile-development.mdc](mdc:mobile-development.mdc)** - React Native + TypeScript mobile development guidelines  
- **[backend-development.mdc](mdc:backend-development.mdc)** - Node.js + Express + Supabase backend development guidelines

### Quality & Process Rules
- **[testing-qa.mdc](mdc:testing-qa.mdc)** - Testing strategies, TDD, and quality assurance
- **[deployment-environment.mdc](mdc:deployment-environment.mdc)** - Deployment, environment management, and CI/CD
- **[ux-accessibility.mdc](mdc:ux-accessibility.mdc)** - User experience and accessibility standards

### Integration Rules
- **[ai-database-integration.mdc](mdc:ai-database-integration.mdc)** - AI (Google Gemini) and database (Supabase) integration patterns

## Quick Reference

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Zustand
- **Mobile**: React Native, TypeScript, React Navigation, AsyncStorage
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Supabase, Google AI (Gemini), Firebase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Deployment**: Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend)

### Key Principles
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implement features
2. **Accessibility First**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. **Performance**: Optimize for fast, responsive interactions
4. **Security**: Follow security best practices
5. **Consistency**: Use established patterns and conventions

### Development Workflow
1. Read relevant rule files before starting work
2. Write tests first for major changes
3. Follow platform-specific guidelines
4. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
5. Test accessibility and performance
6. Document any external setup requirements

## Getting Started

When working on any part of the Mind Clear project:

1. **Start with [project-structure.mdc](mdc:project-structure.mdc)** to understand the overall architecture
2. **Read the platform-specific rule** for your development area:
   - Frontend work → [frontend-development.mdc](mdc:frontend-development.mdc)
   - Mobile work → [mobile-development.mdc](mdc:mobile-development.mdc)  
   - Backend work → [backend-development.mdc](mdc:backend-development.mdc)
3. **Follow [testing-qa.mdc](mdc:testing-qa.mdc)** for testing requirements
4. **Check [ux-accessibility.mdc](mdc:ux-accessibility.mdc)** for user experience guidelines
5. **Reference [ai-database-integration.mdc](mdc:ai-database-integration.mdc)** for AI and database work

## Important Notes

- Always use "Mind Clear" as the app name in user-facing content
- Never commit `.env` files or sensitive data
- Write comprehensive tests for all new features
- Ensure proper accessibility compliance
- Follow the established error handling patterns
- Use proper environment variable management
- Implement proper security measures
